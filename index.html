            <strong>Hi Founders &amp; Coders &#x1F44B;, I'm Sean.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope you'll accept me into your foundation programme.
            I already have a fair bit of experience with software development.
            But about 8 years ago, I put my career aside to take care of my kids.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that they're older, I'm ready to resume that journey.
            But my skills are rusty, and I could use some help getting back up to speed. 
            And I would love to be of service to others starting out on this path.
        </p>
        <p>
            My last job was as a frontend web developer for an edtech startup called
            <a href="https://learnship.com" target="_blank">Learnship</a>.
            I worked there for 7 years.
            When I started, the company had 12 employees and only a handful of customers.
            By the time I left, we had offices in 5 countries across 3 continents.
            150 staff members supported a network of more than 1000 freelance teachers.
            Revenues had climbed to the tens of millions of Euro.
        </p>
        <p>
            Programming wasn't the only thing I did at Learnship.
            Initially, I taught classes and designed lessons.
            As the company grew and added staff, I headed up material development.
            From there I moved on to writing code.
        </p>
        <p>
            That trajectory reflected my versatility as well as background.
            Before moving to software development, I'd been an educator.
            I love learning, and I love designing and making things.
            In addition to working with bits and bytes, crafting physical objects is a central part of my life.
            In the work that I do, I'm guided by an ethos of service, empowerment and equity.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm grateful for the chance I've had to center the lives of my children over the last 8 years.
            Now I look forward to returning to full-time work and widening my contributions.
            Since the first meetup, I've been thrilled to encounter the joyful spirit of Founders & Coders.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would appreciate a chance to speak more about my experience.
            And I would be honored if accepted into the upcoming cohort.
        </p>
